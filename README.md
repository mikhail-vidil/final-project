# final-project
Simple e-commerce website\
In this project I mastered:  
* Layout:  
  * Desktop  
  * Tablet  
  * Mobile  
* CSS Flexbox  
* Website functionality with JS:  
  * best offer (items for best offer outlined on a start page, can be scrolled and added to shopping bag)    
  * photos switcher (when click on thumbnail it replace main image with full size image of itself)  
  * shopping bag (add items, delete items, increase/decrease quantity of goods, outline total price and quantity of goods in header)  
  * local storage (to save data when user navigates across the site)
